# Wicked2OLSystem
C++20 WickedEngine Game Example Template + Wicked2OLSystem lib


------------

It piggy backs the Example_ImGui_Docking project from wicked engine, only Example_ImGui_Docking is altered and included, the rest of the files are setup as a seperate static lib. 

Goal of this Project:
Was to make a free 2OLSystem that evolved into a Time and Node based Arboreal Geometry Generator using wicked engine for contemporary rendering.

two months ago I started writing a game engine for myself and plan to finish and integrate this as a core feature, you'll notice if you use this that it's unfinished, it doesn't calculate correctly and is only everything you need up to the point of it working. These photos are from various iterations such as the stocastic stage.. I have since moved to a much more diverse system know as a 2OL system, with time and node based design so it's actually a hybrid system to simulate plant growth in stages and animate it.
