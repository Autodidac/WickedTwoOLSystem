# Wicked2OLSystem
C++20 WickedEngine Game Example Template + Wicked2OLSystem lib


------------

It piggy backs the Example_ImGui_Docking project from wicked engine, only Example_ImGui_Docking is altered and included, the rest of the files are setup as a seperate static lib. 

Goal of this Project:
Was to make a free 2OLSystem that evolved into a Time and Node based Arboreal Geometery Generator using wicked engine for contemporary rendering.
