C++20 WickedEngine Game Example Template

Modern Game Architecture WickedEngine-Game Example Template for GitHub.

  Essentially I want to encapsulate everything between "writing game code" and "writing engine code".

Mission Goal of this Project: "just make games, not engines" or "utility libraries". 
Also provide a Game Example Template for Robust Community Support for Lots of Next Generation Game Software.
